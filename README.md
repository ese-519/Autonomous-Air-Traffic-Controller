### DESCRIPTION AND GOALS

Description: Autonomous ATC will coordinate several quadrotors trying to simulate a TRACON environment. The quadrotors will be asked to follow a preset series of waypoints. Goal is to also establish communication giving commands similar to ATC directives like holding, new routing etc.

Goals: For the project, Autonomous ATC will simulate following situations :
a. Sequential take-off and landing
b. Parallel take-off and landing
c. Emergency landings
(TODO: Add a brief description of the project and Final Goals)
